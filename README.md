This repository allows users to calculate the temporal focus of
speeches in the DÃ¡il between 1945 and 2013. 

It also models the future focus as a function of legislator age, and
cohort.

The repository is *not* self-contained. In order to run all of the
code contained here, you will need to download the original speech
data from [Harvard
Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/6MZN76).
